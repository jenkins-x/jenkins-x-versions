# Jenkins X Versions

This repository  contains the consistent set of versions of packages and helm charts for use with [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) and its associated Apps to provide a [stable version stream](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/version-stream/).

* [charts](charts) contains the versions of [helm](https://www.helm.sh/) charts
* [docker](docker) contains the versions of container images
* [packages](packages) contains the versions of CLI tools like `jx`, `helm` etc

## Update to latest versions of all depdendencies

To update all the dependencies in the repo to their latest version run

    jx step create pr versions -f '*' --images
    
If there is an existing PR to bump versions it will be updated. This command is run using Kubernetes `CronJob` every 12 hours so you normally only need to run it manually if you want to update dependencies faster.

If a PR created using this step is showing conflicts the easiest way to resolve it is to close the PR and rerun the command.

## Layout

Each folder contains a list of YAML files for each package or chart name which contains its `version` and its `gitUrl`, `url` to the GitHub project storing its source code.

## Managing versions

By default this git repository is used by the [jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx) binary whenever it needs to install a helm a chart so that rather than using the latest released chart, we can keep the versions locked down to known good versions.

Then as charts get released we can generate Pull Requests against this repository which will then trigger our [BDD tests](https://github.com/jenkins-x/bdd-jx) via [jx step bdd](https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_step_bdd/) and verify the new chart version works.

## BDD Test Pipelines

You can browse all of the separate BDD tests we run on different kinds of cluster and installation in the [jx/bdd](jx/bdd) folder.

## Running the BDD Tests on a PR

You can test each context individually on a PR via a comment like:

    /test tekton
    
Or to run them all

    /test all
    
Or to run all the boot based BDD tests

    /test boot

## Cluster Deletion

BDD clusters are marked for deletion if the tests pass or after 2 hours from the cluster creation date if the tests fail. If you would like your cluster to not be deleted you can run:

```
jx step e2e label --keep clusterName --project-id=jenkins-x-bdd3
```
The above command will add a label to the cluster with the value `keep-me=true`

To mark the cluster for deletion again run:

```
jx step e2e label --delete clusterName --project-id=jenkins-x-bdd3
```
The above command will add a label to the cluster with the value `delete-me=true`
